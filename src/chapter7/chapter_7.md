# Noesis

Noesis in Greek means, "insight", "to understand" or "to see".  I thought it was a good name for a
webassembly module intended to grab data from different sources and as a helper for tensorflowjs.

## What it does

Noesis will be a slowly growing webassembly module that will do the following:

- WebRTC handling, including getting MediaStreams and MediaDevices
- Tensor'izing data from websockets
- Tensor'izing data from MediaStreams

## How it works
